## Selected projects in data science, data analyst and machine learning

### Development of information technologies for optimisation of grain elevator operation using neural network models and reinforcement learning methods (2022-2023)


2 of the 3 stages have been completed. As of March 2023, a report on intermediate stages 1 and 2 was developed and accepted by the customer. In particular, for Stage 2, "Development of the architecture of the system's neural network modules and planning and conducting experiments with their help to improve the SAKURA-APM system". To order: INNOVINPROM LLC as a subcontractor of the BOWI project under the EU Horizon Programme.
 •	analysing analogues for optimising the technological process using intelligent information technologies; 

 •	designing the architecture of neural networks of typical nodal devices of grain elevator routes and identifying models of the technological process of grain elevator operation; 

 •	planning of experiments necessary for training neural network models of nodal devices and the system as a whole, 

 •	panels for visualisation of the modelling results of these experiments were prepared.

### Development of sections of the state monitoring programme in the field of atmospheric air protection in Vinnytsia region (No. DR 0121U110737) (2021)
 •	Analytical processing of the input data was carried out, maps of the distribution of pollutant concentrations in the Vinnytsia zone were built, and emission sources were geocoded. Based on the analytics for the previous 5 years and taking into account the requirements of the CMU Resolution No. 827 of 14.08.2019 and EU Directive 2008/50/EC, an improved state monitoring network in the field of air protection was designed. 
 
•	Draft sections of the State Monitoring Programme in the field of atmospheric air protection for the Vinnytsia zone for 2022-2026 were developed.

•	On request: Innovinprom LLC and the Department of Territorial and Infrastructure Development of Vinnytsia Regional State Administration
